# A Simple Java Lexer

My college used to have a course where people would write programming 
languages, and I see the assignment to write a lexer, and I was like, 
what if I implemented it with the class structure of my choice (I wasn't
in the class, I just get nerd-sniped easily), so this is the result 
of that experiment. I feel it's a pretty clean implementation of a java
program which can lex itself.
